# Token Liquidity Intelligence Platform

A high-quality Web3 reference project designed to demonstrate how token liquidity
can be analyzed, simulated, and explained across decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
on EVM-compatible blockchains such as Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and Arbitrum.

This repository focuses on **liquidity pools, trading volume flow, price impact
logic, and liquidity health metrics** using clean, readable, and beginner-friendly
blockchain intelligence patterns.

## Supported Networks
- Ethereum
- Base
- Polygon
- Arbitrum

---

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate how token liquidity can be measured
- Simulate liquidity pool depth and volume flow
- Explain price impact and slippage logic
- Track liquidity health metrics
- Teach DEX data flow using structured reference code

---

## Features
- Liquidity pool analyzer
- Volume flow simulator
- Price impact calculator
- Slippage estimation logic
- Network configuration handler
- Clean, modular reference code
- Beginner-friendly documentation

---

## Repository Structure
All files are located in the root directory for simplicity:

- `network.config.js` → Blockchain and RPC configuration  
- `liquidity.analyzer.js` → Pool liquidity analysis  
- `volume.flow.js` → Trading volume simulation  
- `price.impact.js` → Price impact calculation  
- `slippage.model.js` → Slippage estimation model  
- `rpc.client.js` → RPC connection handler  
- `address.utils.js` → Token validation helpers  
- `index.js` → Main reference entry file  
- `dex.metrics.js` → DEX analytics model  
- `liquidity.simulator.js` → Liquidity simulation logic  

---

## How It Works
1. Connects to a blockchain RPC endpoint  
2. Reads DEX configuration  
3. Simulates liquidity pool behavior  
4. Calculates price impact and slippage  
5. Analyzes trading volume flow  
6. Outputs structured liquidity insights  

---

## Configuration
Open `network.config.js` and update:
- `NETWORK` to select your blockchain
- `TOKEN_ADDRESS` to analyze a token

---

## Use Cases
- DEX analytics dashboards  
- Liquidity health monitoring  
- Token market research  
- Web3 developer onboarding  
- On-chain trading experiments
